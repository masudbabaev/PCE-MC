# PCE-MC
This project compares Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods for uncertainty quantification in reservoir simulations.

**Features**
Load simulation data
Build PCE model using chaospy
Compare PCE with MC results
Export polynomial terms to CSV, Excel, Word
Plot input/output distributions

**Requirements**
Python libraries: pandas, numpy, chaospy, matplotlib, seaborn, openpyxl, python-docx

**How to Use**
Put your CSV file in the project folder
Update the file path in the script
Run the script to load data, build the model, and generate results
